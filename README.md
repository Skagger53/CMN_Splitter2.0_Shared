# CMN Splitter 2.0
**Github files for CMN Splitter**

Highly specific application for processing MN DHS Case Mix Notice PDFs.

Each PDF from DHS contains at least one letter. This software imports the PDF and exports into a new directory each letter as an individual PDF. Each new PDF has a file name with all relevant information in it, so the user does not need to view the PDF contents.

Optional configuration available in CMN Splitter by pressing Ctrl + Shift + O.
